# AudioProcessing_Project
Audio Processing - S7 ENSEA

We want to build an application that can record a sound from a microphone in
real time, display the wave form and the spectrum on a chart, apply some effect
(like an echo chamber), and play it back to the headphone plug.

Java JDK 21 & JavaFX 21.0.2
